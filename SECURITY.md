# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We aim to support the latest published version of `@phcdevworks/spectre-tokens`. Older releases may not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers or reach out via the private channels listed in the repository (e.g., `SECURITY_CONTACT` if present). Provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess impact:
- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Affected versions (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and keep you informed of the fix status. Responsible disclosure is appreciated.
